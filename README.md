  ## Usage
  Play the game <a href="https://bethanyproctor.github.io/wack-a-mole/">here</a>. Click on the moles and avoid the piranha plant! Your score will increase every time you correctly click on a mole, and the game will be over if you accidentally click on a piranha plant. Reset the game as many times you want to try to get a high score!
